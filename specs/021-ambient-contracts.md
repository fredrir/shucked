# 021: Ambient Contracts

## Status

Proposed

## Summary

Add a general contract layer for external behavior that Shuck cannot recover
from the analyzed source graph. Contracts are shell-agnostic at the config
surface: a contract has an activation (`when`) and a set of effects (`reads`,
`consumes`, `provides`, and function `sets`). Zsh plugin loading from spec 020
is one activation type, not a separate contract system.

The default posture stays source-first. When Shuck can load a sourced helper,
framework module, or plugin entrypoint, it should parse that file, follow its
source closure, run the ambient collector for that file entry, and derive
`FileContract`s from real code. Contracts only describe residual behavior such
as generated code, external runtime consumption, unavailable source, or
project-specific framework conventions.

Contracts come from end-user configuration or from Shuck's well-known registry.
Plugin-authored contract files are out of scope for v1. The registry is
code-defined, not TOML, so Shuck can cheaply test activations and instantiate
`FileContract`s only for contracts that actually apply.

## Motivation

Spec 020 and the current zsh plugin fixtures already solve a large class of
false positives by loading real plugins:

- a Prezto module request can resolve the `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin root;
- a `zdot_use_plugin zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions` call can resolve the same
  standalone plugin;
- the resolved plugin file registers a zsh hook;
- source-closure summarization follows the deferred hook callback and discovers
  that `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY` is read later;
- the caller assignment is then kept live without any plugin-specific variable
  table.

That is the model to preserve. It also fixes return-by-reference patterns when
callee source is reachable: sourced helpers and loaded plugin files can expose
function contracts that provide `reply` or `REPLY` to callers. Those should not
be re-modeled as hand-written contracts.

The remaining need is broader than zsh plugins. Projects may need to describe
names consumed or provided by CI runtimes, shell frameworks, generated code,
test harnesses, deployment wrappers, or plugins whose source is unavailable or
too dynamic to summarize. A single top-level contract feature gives users one
mental model instead of separate zsh, plugin, framework, and global escape
hatches.

## Design

### Goals

- Keep real source loading and source summarization as the first choice.
- Make contracts a general lint feature, not a zsh-only feature.
- Use activation types to decide when a contract applies.
- Treat `zsh_plugin` and future plugin/framework integrations as activation
  types over the same contract body.
- Ship well-known contracts through a lazy Rust registry rather than parsing
  built-in TOML.
- Keep end-user names concise and close to the user intent.
- Compile contracts into the existing `FileContract` type.
- Avoid rule-local or framework-local tables of plugin variable names.

### Non-Goals

- This spec does not replace zsh plugin resolution from spec 020.
- This spec does not model language semantics such as zsh `$+name` existence
  tests. Those belong in parser/semantic/linter logic.
- This spec does not define plugin-distributed contract files.
- This spec does not execute plugin managers or user shell code.
- This spec does not emit diagnostics from plugin files as top-level user-file
  diagnostics.

### Source-First Rule

Every proposed contract should pass this question first:

> Could Shuck load a real source file and derive this fact instead?

If yes, prefer improving source resolution, plugin resolution, helper
summarization, deferred runtime modeling, or ambient collector threading. Use a
contract only when the fact is intentionally outside the static source graph or
when the source is unavailable to the analyzed project.

Examples:

| Case | Preferred mechanism |
|---|---|
| `zsh-autosuggestions` hook reads `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY` | Load plugin source and summarize deferred hook callback |
| Sourced helper sets `reply` for caller | Source closure and function contract summarization |
| `$+functions[name]` reports undefined `+functions` | Fix zsh parameter/arithmetic semantics |
| CI injects names that a checked script reads | Contract activated for matching files |
| `ZSH_TMUX_*` options are consumed by plugin/runtime code Shuck cannot statically reach | Contract activated by `zsh_plugin` |
| `zdot` module metadata is assigned in module files and consumed by a dispatcher | Contract activated for matching files |

### Contract Shape

Use one top-level contract section. Built-in controls live on the section, and
user-authored contracts live under `[[lint.contracts.custom]]`:

```toml
[lint.contracts]
well-known = true
disabled = ["zsh/oh-my-zsh/plugin/tmux"]

[[lint.contracts.custom]]
id = "github-actions-env"
when = "always"
files = [".github/**/*.sh"]
provides = { variables = ["GITHUB_OUTPUT", "GITHUB_ENV"] }

[[lint.contracts.custom]]
id = "oh-my-zsh-tmux"
when = { type = "zsh_plugin", framework = "oh-my-zsh", plugin = "tmux" }
files = ["**/.zshrc"]
consumes = { prefixes = ["ZSH_TMUX_"] }

[[lint.contracts.custom]]
id = "zdot-module-metadata"
when = "always"
files = ["modules/**/*.zsh"]
consumes = { names = ["ZDOT_MODULE"], prefixes = ["ZDOT_"] }
```

`files` is an optional path filter. If omitted, the activation decides
applicability. Users can intentionally make a repository-wide contract with
`when = "always"` and no `files`, but docs should recommend path filters for
most contracts. For request-based activations such as `zsh_plugin`, `files`
matches the file that requested the plugin, not the resolved plugin entrypoint.

`well-known = false` disables the built-in registry entirely. `disabled`
selectors apply when the registry is enabled and can turn off individual
built-ins or groups.

`id` is a stable selector token, not only a display name. Config contracts must
have an `id` so diagnostics, generated docs, replacement, and disable behavior
can point at the same contract across runs.

### Activation Types

Activation decides when a contract is eligible.

```toml
when = "always"
when = { type = "zsh_plugin", framework = "oh-my-zsh", plugin = "tmux" }
when = { type = "zsh_theme", framework = "oh-my-zsh", theme = "agnoster" }
```

Initial activation types:

| Activation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `always` | Apply to matching files without an additional runtime condition. This is the global-contract form. |
| `zsh_plugin` | Apply when Shuck observes or configures a matching zsh plugin request and plugin resolution is enabled. |
| `zsh_theme` | Apply when Shuck observes or configures a matching zsh theme request and plugin resolution is enabled. |

Future activation types can reuse the same contract body:

- `sourced_file`, for contracts attached to a specific helper path;
- `command`, for framework commands that establish ambient state;
- `shell`, for shell-specific entry contracts that are too project-specific for
  built-in ambient providers.

### Identity, Groups, And Controls

`id` alone is not enough for built-in controls. Well-known contracts need a
stable exact ID plus stable grouping selectors. That lets users disable one
contract, a whole framework family, or every well-known contract without
depending on a human-readable label.

Well-known IDs should be hierarchical:

```text
zsh/oh-my-zsh/plugin/tmux
zsh/standalone/plugin/zsh-abbr
runtime/github-actions/env
```

Each well-known contract also declares groups:

```rust
groups: &[
    "zsh",
    "zsh/oh-my-zsh",
    "zsh/oh-my-zsh/plugin",
]
```

Selectors are bare well-known IDs or groups:

```toml
[lint.contracts]
disabled = [
  # Disable all built-in contracts.
  "*",
  # Disable all built-in Oh My Zsh contracts.
  "zsh/oh-my-zsh",
  # Disable only one built-in contract.
  "zsh/oh-my-zsh/plugin/tmux",
]
```

A selector matches if it equals the contract ID or one of the contract groups.
`*` matches every built-in contract. The selector space is intentionally scoped
to the well-known registry: custom contracts are controlled by adding, removing,
or editing their config entries.

Custom contracts can replace built-ins without requiring a separate disabled
entry:

```toml
[[lint.contracts.custom]]
id = "local-oh-my-zsh-tmux"
replaces = ["zsh/oh-my-zsh/plugin/tmux"]
when = { type = "zsh_plugin", framework = "oh-my-zsh", plugin = "tmux" }
consumes = { prefixes = ["LOCAL_TMUX_"] }
```

`replaces` is equivalent to adding those selectors to `disabled` and then
adding the custom contract. It is useful when a repo wants to override the
built-in behavior while keeping the override next to the replacement contract.

### Effects

Effect names should be short and user-facing. They compile to `FileContract`
fields internally.

```toml
reads = ["CALLER_VALUE"]
consumes = { names = ["FAST_WORK_DIR"], prefixes = ["ABBR_"], all = false }
provides = { variables = ["reply"], functions = ["helper"] }
functions = [
  { name = "helper", reads = ["CALLER_VALUE"], sets = ["REPLY"] },
]
```

Mapping:

| User field | Internal meaning |
|---|---|
| `reads` | `required_reads`; creates synthetic reads in the importer. |
| `consumes.names` | `externally_consumed_binding_names`; keeps exact assignments live. |
| `consumes.prefixes` | `externally_consumed_binding_prefixes`; keeps prefix assignments live. |
| `consumes.all` | `externally_consumed_bindings`; rare escape hatch. |
| `provides.variables` | `provided_bindings` with variable kind, definite certainty, and file-entry initialization. |
| `provides.functions` | `provided_bindings` with function kind and empty `provided_functions` for callable names. |
| `functions[].reads` | Required reads for a provided function. |
| `functions[].sets` | Definite variable bindings a provided function may set for its caller, such as `reply` or `REPLY`. |

The simple string-list form is intentionally opinionated: `provides.variables`
means the variable is available and initialized when the contract applies. That
matches end-user cases like CI-provided environment names. If users later need
weaker declarations such as "name exists but may be unset", add object forms
rather than overloading the simple list.

### Effect Scope And Timing

Contracts need explicit timing so they do not become a bag of fake reads.

| Effect | Timing |
|---|---|
| `reads` | Ordered. The activated runtime reads the caller environment at the activation span. For `when = "always"` this is file entry; for `zsh_plugin` this is the observed plugin request. |
| `consumes` | File-scoped. An external runtime may observe assignments made by the matching file, regardless of lexical order. This is for unused-assignment analysis only. |
| `provides` | Ordered. Bindings become visible at file entry for `always`, or at the activation span for request-based activations such as `zsh_plugin`. |
| `functions[].reads` and `functions[].sets` | Call-scoped. The function contract applies when the named function is called. |

`reads` and `consumes` are not interchangeable:

- Use `reads` when the activated thing actually reads a name at activation
  time. This can create a synthetic read, keep earlier assignments live, and
  still report uninitialized reads when nothing provides the name.
- Use `consumes` when something outside the analyzed file may observe matching
  assignments after the file has run. This should not create lexical
  references and should not satisfy uninitialized-variable checks.

For request-based activations, `consumes` targets the requesting file, not the
resolved helper or plugin entrypoint. A `zsh_plugin` contract that consumes
`ZSH_TMUX_*` keeps matching assignments in the `.zshrc` live; it does not mark
assignments inside the tmux plugin file as externally consumed.

### Well-Known Registry

Shuck should maintain a built-in registry for well-known contracts that are
stable enough to ship with the project. This covers cases like known plugin
configuration prefixes or project/runtime contracts that are too specific for
language semantics but common enough that users should not have to rediscover
them.

The registry should be Rust data and functions, not embedded TOML:

```rust
pub struct WellKnownContract {
    pub id: &'static str,
    pub groups: &'static [&'static str],
    pub label: &'static str,
    pub activation: WellKnownActivation,
    pub matches: fn(&ContractQuery<'_>) -> bool,
    pub apply: fn(&mut FileContract),
}

pub enum WellKnownActivation {
    Always,
    ZshPlugin {
        framework: &'static str,
        plugin: &'static str,
    },
    ZshTheme {
        framework: &'static str,
        theme: &'static str,
    },
}

pub struct ContractQuery<'a> {
    pub source_path: &'a Path,
    pub shell_profile: &'a ShellProfile,
    pub activation: ContractActivationQuery<'a>,
}
```

Selection is lazy:

1. contract controls skip disabled selectors before any materialization;
2. cheap activation check, such as exact `zsh_plugin` framework/plugin match;
3. optional path/source predicate through `matches`;
4. only then call `apply` to materialize names into a `FileContract`.

This mirrors the current `ambient_contracts` provider shape:

```rust
struct AmbientContractProvider {
    matches: fn(&AmbientContractCollector<'_>, ShellDialect) -> bool,
    build: fn(&AmbientContractCollector<'_>, ShellDialect) -> FileContract,
}
```

The registry should use the same idea but make activation explicit. Simple
contracts can use helper functions that apply static slices:

```rust
fn apply_oh_my_zsh_tmux(contract: &mut FileContract) {
    add_consumed_prefixes(contract, &["ZSH_TMUX_"]);
}
```

That avoids:

- deserializing built-in TOML;
- compiling glob patterns for contracts that can never activate;
- allocating `Name`s or `FileContract`s for inactive contracts;
- spreading plugin-specific variable tables through plugin-manager code.

Controls should be evaluated before `apply`, so disabling
`zsh/oh-my-zsh` skips the whole family without constructing any per-contract
`FileContract`s.

### Registry Ownership

The well-known registry should not live in `plugin_managers`. The files under
`crates/shuck-semantic/src/source_closure/plugin_managers` should continue to
emit common source-closure outputs: plugin requests, dependency requests,
layout suffixes, and bounded deferred runtime reads.

The registry should also not turn `shuck-semantic/src/plugins` into a policy
catalog. `shuck-semantic` owns `FileContract` and the resolver traits; it should
not own the list of plugin variables that suppress linter diagnostics.

Preferred ownership:

- `shuck-linter` owns the well-known registry, next to `ambient_contracts`,
  because these contracts are lint-facing ambient assumptions.
- `shuck-cli` combines user config and the well-known registry when building
  semantic options and plugin-resolution hooks.
- `shuck-semantic` receives only resulting contract effects through
  `SemanticBuildOptions`, `PluginResolution.file_entry_contracts`, or a sibling
  request-site consumption hook if `consumes` cannot share the imported-facts
  path.

### Internal Flow

The existing source-closure flow remains the join point:

```text
primary file
  -> file-entry ambient collector
  -> source refs and plugin requests
  -> resolved helper/plugin entrypoints
  -> helper/plugin source summaries
  -> activated well-known and custom contracts
  -> merged FileContract
  -> final semantic resolution and linter facts
```

`PluginResolution.file_entry_contracts` remains the right hook for ordered
plugin-request effects that behave like imported helper facts: `reads`,
`provides`, and `functions`. The resolver should fill this field from compiled
config and well-known registry matches after resolving the logical request. It
should not fill it from hard-coded framework/plugin name tables.

`consumes` needs request-site handling because it affects assignments in the
file that requested the plugin. Implementation should carry those effects back
to the source-closure site that observed the request and mark matching caller
bindings as externally consumed.

Contracts activated by `always` can use the existing
`SemanticBuildOptions.file_entry_contract` path for the primary file and the
existing `FileEntryContractCollectorFactory` path for helper/plugin summaries.
If implementation needs a named provider, the provider should compile to
`FileContract` before semantic application.

### Crate Boundaries

- `shuck-semantic` owns `FileContract`, contract merging, and semantic
  application.
- `shuck-semantic` should not parse contract config.
- `shuck-semantic` should not own the well-known registry.
- `shuck-config` owns deserializable config shapes.
- `shuck-linter` owns built-in well-known contract descriptors.
- `shuck-cli` compiles config, queries the well-known registry, and installs
  resulting contracts in the resolver/collector pipeline.
- `shuck-linter` consumes semantic facts and should not know contract origins.

### Validation Rules

- well-known contract `id` and `groups` values are stable selector API.
- well-known contract `label` values are human-facing only and must not be used
  for selection.
- custom contract `id` values are required and must be unique within the merged
  project config.
- `files` patterns use the same matching rules as other per-file settings.
- `disabled` selectors must be valid well-known IDs, groups, or `*`, such as
  `zsh/oh-my-zsh` or `*`.
- `replaces` selectors follow the same syntax as `disabled`.
- variable and function names are validated against the target shell profile
  when known; otherwise they use the portable shell identifier subset.
- prefixes must be non-empty and valid identifier prefixes for the target
  shell profile.
- `when = "always"` is the only string shorthand in v1.
- unknown activation types are configuration errors.
- malformed config contracts are configuration errors.
- `provides.variables` string-list entries always mean definite initialized
  file-entry bindings.
- `consumes` may only name variables or prefixes; functions must use
  `provides.functions` or `functions[]`.

### Cache And Watch

Contract inputs affect diagnostics and must participate in dependency tracking.

Cache fingerprints include:

- resolved plugin entrypoints;
- project config files that define contracts;
- helper files summarized because of source closure.

Well-known registry entries are versioned with the binary and do not need
runtime dependency fingerprints. They should participate in the normal settings
cache key through the Shuck version plus the enabled/disabled/replaced contract
settings.

Watch mode refreshes these targets after each run, matching the dependency
refresh model from spec 020.

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep Contracts Under `[lint.zsh]`

Rejected. The same model is useful for non-zsh scripts and project runtimes.
Zsh plugin loading should be an activation type over a common contract body,
not the namespace that owns all contracts.

### Separate Global And Plugin Contract Systems

Rejected. This creates duplicate names, duplicate validation, and confusing
mental models. `always` and `zsh_plugin` activations are enough to distinguish
the two cases.

### Use `name` As The Contract Selector

Rejected. A display name is not a strong enough grouping mechanism. Built-ins
need stable IDs and groups so users can disable a single contract or a whole
family such as `zsh/oh-my-zsh`.

### Use Verbose Internal Field Names In Config

Rejected. Names like `externally-consumed-binding-prefixes` describe
implementation details, not user intent. Config should use short terms:
`reads`, `consumes`, `provides`, and `sets`.

### Store Built-In Contracts As TOML

Rejected. TOML would keep user and built-in syntax identical, but it would
force Shuck to parse and deserialize built-in data at runtime or add a build
step that eventually recreates a Rust registry. Code-defined descriptors give
the same behavior with cheaper activation checks and lazy `FileContract`
materialization.

### Hard-Code Plugin Variable Tables In Rust

Rejected when the tables live in plugin managers, semantic layout code, or
rules. A well-known registry is still Rust code, but it is intentionally
centralized, activated through the same contract model as user config, and
compiled into `FileContract` only after a matching activation is observed.

### Make Contracts The Primary Plugin Model

Rejected. The current fixtures already prove that loading real plugin source
solves meaningful cases, including deferred zsh hook reads. Contracts should
not become a substitute for improving resolution and source summarization.

## Verification

### Unit Tests

- parse valid `[[lint.contracts.custom]]` entries;
- parse `when = "always"`;
- parse `zsh_plugin` and `zsh_theme` activations;
- reject unknown activation types;
- reject duplicate custom IDs;
- parse `disabled` and `replaces` selectors;
- reject malformed names and prefixes;
- compile `reads`, `consumes`, `provides`, and `functions[].sets` into expected
  `FileContract` values;
- query the well-known registry without allocating contracts when activation
  does not match;
- query the well-known registry without allocating contracts when a disabled
  selector matches the exact ID or a group;
- materialize a well-known registry entry into the expected `FileContract` only
  after activation and path matching succeed;
- deduplicate repeated names and prefixes deterministically;
- verify `provides.variables` string-list entries compile as initialized
  file-entry bindings.

### Semantic Tests

- plugin source summaries still derive `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY` reads without
  any custom contract config;
- source closure still derives `reply`/`REPLY` function contracts when helper
  source is reachable;
- `always` contracts apply to matching primary files and helper/plugin files;
- `zsh_plugin` contracts apply only when the matching plugin request is loaded;
- a well-known `zsh_plugin` `reads` contract flows through
  `PluginResolution.file_entry_contracts` at the plugin request span;
- `consumes.prefixes` keeps matching C001 candidates live without creating fake
  lexical reads;
- request-based `consumes.prefixes` marks assignments in the requesting file,
  not assignments in the resolved plugin entrypoint;
- `reads` produces synthetic reads at the importer/load site;
- `reads` does not keep assignments after the activation live, while `consumes`
  does.

### End-To-End Tests

- an `always` contract can model a project runtime variable in a non-zsh shell
  script;
- a `tmux` oh-my-zsh contract keeps `ZSH_TMUX_*` assignments live only when the
  `tmux` plugin is loaded;
- a custom `zsh_plugin` contract keeps `ABBR_*` assignments live when the
  standalone plugin is resolved;
- a `zdot` contract can describe project-specific module metadata without
  making those names first-class zsh runtime globals;
- disabling plugin resolution prevents `zsh_plugin` contracts from applying,
  while `always` contracts still apply to matching files.

### Commands

```bash
cargo test -p shuck-config contracts
cargo test -p shuck-semantic contract
cargo test -p shuck-linter unused_assignment
cargo test -p shuck-cli contract
just test
just corpus test SHUCK_LARGE_CORPUS_RULES=C001,C006
```

The large-corpus run belongs after implementation, not after this spec-only
change.
