//! Native resolver for `# shucked: source=` directive target paths.
//!
//! The source closure already resolves a directive path relative to the
//! annotating file's own directory. This resolver adds the configured
//! `[lint] source-paths` roots as additional search directories, mirroring the
//! ShellCheck-compat `--source-path` behavior, and exposes a helper for
//! resolving a `SourceRef` to concrete on-disk targets (used to decide which
//! `lint=true` targets to lint).
